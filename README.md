# Advent of Code 2020

I'm giving [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) a spin in my first [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020).
 
Why Clojure? To get some experience with [Functional Programming](https://clojure.org/about/functional_programming) and to get to test [clojure.spec](https://clojure.org/about/spec). Also I found Rich Hickeys talks [Simple Made Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oytL881p-nQ) and [Design, Composition, and Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCZ3YgeEUPg) inspiring.

I wish I knew about the [Clojure Cheat Sheet](https://clojure.org/api/cheatsheet) before I started. Suppose I should have RTFM. Some days I also implement a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) version to compare, as that's what I usually use.

## Post Mortem

It was fun while it lasted, after 11 days completed I have to prioritize saving Christmas IRL. I struggled a but with the datastructures in Clojure for the last couple of days and had to 'cheat' with Julia. Might come back to those later, but most probably not.
